1. It translates the entire source code into machine code before execution.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers convert the whole source code into machine code at once, producing an executable file. This allows for faster execution as no further translation is needed during runtime.
2. It executes the source code line by line, translating each line just before executing it.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreters read and execute the source code line by line, translating it on the fly. This allows for immediate execution but can slow down overall performance.
3. Programs generally run faster after translation because the machine code is already generated.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compiled programs are pre-translated into machine code, meaning the CPU can execute them directly without needing any further interpretation.
4. It requires less memory during execution since it doesn't need to keep the source code in memory.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Only the compiled machine code is loaded into memory, not the original source, reducing memory usage compared to interpreters.
5. Errors are reported after analyzing the entire source code, making debugging more challenging.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers check the entire source code for errors before execution, which means multiple errors are reported at once, making debugging more complex.
6. It stops execution at the point of an error, allowing for easier debugging.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreters halt execution as soon as an error is encountered, which helps programmers quickly locate and fix issues line by line.
7. The source code is kept hidden from the end user, as only the machine code is distributed.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers produce standalone executables that don’t include the original source code, protecting intellectual property.
8. It makes programs more portable since the source code can be executed on any system with the appropriate software.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreted programs depend on the interpreter, not the machine architecture, making the source code portable across platforms.
9. Optimization techniques are applied to improve the performance of the generated machine code.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers optimize machine code before execution for faster performance. Interpreters typically don’t optimize as they translate at runtime.
10. It requires the source code to be present every time the program is executed.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreters need to read the source code at runtime to execute it line by line, whereas compiled executables don’t require the source.
11. It generates an intermediate object code that can be linked with other modules.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers produce object code that can be linked with other libraries or modules to create a final executable.
12. The program execution can be slower because translation happens during runtime.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreters translate each line of code during execution, introducing runtime overhead and slowing down performance.
13. Syntax analysis is completed before execution begins, ensuring all syntax errors are caught upfront.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers check the entire syntax before producing machine code, guaranteeing that the executable is error-free in terms of syntax.
14. It allows for interactive execution and testing of code snippets.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreters support interactive environments (like REPLs) where code can be written, executed, and tested in small chunks.
15. The translated code is usually specific to a particular type of computer architecture.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compiled machine code is tailored to a specific CPU architecture, requiring recompilation for different hardware platforms.
16. It requires a runtime environment to execute the translated code.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreters rely on a runtime environment to read and execute the source code, whereas compiled executables run directly on the hardware.
17. Once translated, the program can be executed multiple times without retranslation.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compiled programs generate a reusable executable file that can be run repeatedly without the need to recompile the source code.
18. It often uses less storage space since no machine code is saved.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreters don’t save machine code, only the source code is stored, which is typically smaller than compiled binaries.
19. The translation process typically takes longer since the entire source is analyzed in one go.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers translate the entire source at once, performing multiple analysis and optimization passes, which takes time.
20. It facilitates dynamic typing and late binding, allowing variables to change types during execution.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Many interpreted languages support dynamic typing, where variable types are checked at runtime, enhancing flexibility.
21. It generally produces more optimized machine code, leading to better performance.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers apply advanced optimization techniques before execution, making the resulting machine code faster and more efficient.
22. It is commonly used in scripting and web-based applications.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Languages like JavaScript and Python are typically interpreted, facilitating dynamic web applications and rapid development.
23. The output of the translation is a standalone executable file.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers produce executable files that can be distributed and run independently of the source code or compiler.
24. It provides better error diagnostics by pointing to the exact line where an error occurs.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreters stop at the error line, providing precise feedback on where and why the error occurred.
25. The development cycle involves separate steps of writing, translating, and linking.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compiled languages require separate stages of compiling and linking, unlike interpreters which execute directly.
26. It allows on-the-fly code modifications, making it useful for rapid prototyping.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Code can be written, modified, and executed interactively, enabling fast iteration during development.
27. Security is enhanced since the end user cannot easily view or modify the source code.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compiled machine code obscures the original source, preventing end users from easily accessing or altering the code.
28. It is typically slower in execution speed due to the overhead of runtime translation.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Runtime translation of each line adds overhead, making interpreted programs slower compared to pre-compiled executables.
29. Memory management can be more efficient since the program structure is fully analyzed before execution.
Answer: Compiler
Explanation: Compilers optimize memory usage during the compilation process, leading to more efficient memory allocation.
30. It is often used for educational purposes to help beginners learn programming concepts.
Answer: Interpreter
Explanation: Interpreted languages are favored in education due to their simplicity and immediate feedback during execution.
