It translates the entire source code into machine code before execution.

Compiler – Correct. Compilers convert all source code to machine code before running.
It executes the source code line by line, translating each line just before executing it.

Interpreter – Correct. Interpreters translate and execute line by line.
Programs generally run faster after translation because the machine code is already generated.

Compiler – Correct. Compiled code is already machine code, so it runs faster.
It requires less memory during execution since it doesn't need to keep the source code in memory.

Compiler – Correct. Only machine code is executed, not the source.
Errors are reported after analyzing the entire source code, making debugging more challenging.

Compiler – Correct. Compilation reports all syntax errors at once.
It stops execution at the point of an error, allowing for easier debugging.

Interpreter – Correct. Interpreters stop at the first error.
The source code is kept hidden from the end user, as only the machine code is distributed.

Compiler – Correct. Only compiled executables are distributed.
It makes programs more portable since the source code can be executed on any system with the appropriate software.

Interpreter – Correct. The source code runs on any system with the right interpreter.
Optimization techniques are applied to improve the performance of the generated machine code.

Compiler – Correct. Compilers optimize machine code for better performance.
It requires the source code to be present every time the program is executed.

Interpreter – Correct. Interpreters read and execute the source code each time.
Second Set
It generates an intermediate object code that can be linked with other modules.

Compiler – Correct. Compilers produce object code for linking.
The program execution can be slower because translation happens during runtime.

Interpreter – Correct. Line-by-line translation slows execution.
Syntax analysis is completed before execution begins, ensuring all syntax errors are caught upfront.

Compiler – Correct. Compilation involves full syntax checking.
It allows for interactive execution and testing of code snippets.

Interpreter – Correct. REPLs (Read-Eval-Print Loops) are common in interpreted languages.
The translated code is usually specific to a particular type of computer architecture.

Compiler – Correct. Machine code is architecture-specific.
It requires a runtime environment to execute the translated code.

Interpreter – Correct. Interpreters need a runtime environment.
Once translated, the program can be executed multiple times without recompilation.

Compiler – Correct. Executable files can be run repeatedly.
It often uses less storage space since no machine code is saved.

Interpreter – Correct. Only source code is stored.
The translation process typically takes longer since the entire source is analyzed in one go.

Compiler – Correct. Compilation is a one-time, lengthy process.
It facilitates dynamic typing and late binding, allowing variables to change types during execution.

Interpreter – Correct. Many interpreted languages are dynamically typed.
Third Set
It generally produces more optimized machine code, leading to better performance.

Compiler – Correct. Compilers optimize machine code for speed and efficiency.
It is commonly used in scripting and web-based applications.

Interpreter – Correct. Languages like JavaScript and Python are often interpreted.
The output of the translation is a standalone executable file.

Compiler – Correct. Compiled languages produce executables.
It provides better error diagnostics by pointing to the exact line where an error occurs.

Interpreter – Correct. Interpreters stop at errors, aiding debugging.
The development cycle involves separate steps of writing, compiling, and linking.

Compiler – Correct. Compilers require this multi-step process.
It allows on-the-fly code modifications, making it useful for rapid prototyping.

Interpreter – Correct. Code can be modified and re-executed immediately.
Security is enhanced since the end user cannot easily view or modify the source code.

Compiler – Correct. Only machine code is distributed, protecting source logic.
It is typically slower in execution speed due to the overhead of runtime translation.

Interpreter – Correct. Runtime interpretation is slower than pre-compiled execution.
Memory management can be more efficient since the program structure is fully analyzed before execution.

Compiler – Correct. Compilers optimize memory usage during compilation.
It is often used for educational purposes to help beginners learn programming concepts.

Interpreter – Correct. Interpreted languages are preferred for teaching due to simplicity.
